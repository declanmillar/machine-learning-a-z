    "The values in the input layer correspond to a single observation (a single row in the database), measuring the values of multiple independent variables that have been standardized or normalized. Standardization ensures that the variables have mean of 0 and a variance of 1. In normalization you subtract the minimum value and divide by the maximum value to get values between 0 and 1. Whether you choose normalization or standardization depends on the scenario. This is necessary to ensure the network works correctly. Further reading on this can be found in Efficient BackProp by Yann LeCun et al (1998).\n",
