# Machine Learning A-Z

My notes from [Machine Learning A-Z: Hands-On Python & R In Data Science](https://www.udemy.com/machinelearning/).

I am only working through the python part of the course, which I am writing up as [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) notebooks. I view the R videos, but am not running the code myself.
