# Machine Learning A-Z

My notes from the [Machine Learning A-Z: Hands-On Python & R In Data Science course](https://www.udemy.com/machinelearning/) on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com), by Kirill Eremenko, Hadelin de Ponteves and the [SuperDataScience Team](https://www.superdatascience.com/pages/machine-learning).

I have written up in many of the lectures in [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) notebooks. These notebooks are intended for my personal learning and progression tracking, by writing up the video lectures in my words (though I use many, many screenshots of the slides); they are no substitute for the course itself, which I highly recommend enrolling on.

To ensure the uploaded notebooks are valid and run correctly, I have set-up a CI pipeline using [GitLab CI](https://about.gitlab.com/product/continuous-integration/) and a [script written by City Science](https://www.cityscience.com/blog/ci-for-jupyter.html).
