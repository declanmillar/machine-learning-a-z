# Machine Learning A-Z

My notes from the [Machine Learning A-Z: Hands-On Python & R In Data Science course on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/machinelearning/), by Kirill Eremenko, Hadelin de Ponteves and the [SuperDataScience Team](https://www.superdatascience.com/pages/machine-learning).

I have written up in many of the lectures in [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) notebooks. These notebooks are intended for my personal learning and progression tracking, by writing up the video lectures in my words (though I use many, many screenshots of the slides); they are no substitute for the course itself, which I highly recommend enrolling on.
